	abstract = {There are currently four medical schools dedicated primarily to training African-American physicians. Two of these schools were established in the last 40 years. For a generation prior to that, only Howard University College of Medicine and Meharry Medical College existed. Forgotten is the history of black medical schools established in the 19th and early 20th centuries, most of which are now defunct. While barriers to the medical education of African Americans in majority institutions have largely disappeared, the continued education of students at our four present-day black medical schools is again threatened. It is incumbent upon us not to allow these modern-day threats to destroy an important resource and legacy in the annals of African-American people. This paper explores medical education in the 19th and 20th centuries, the creation of black medical schools and the forces that lead to the demise of many of these institutions. In recalling this history, we acknowledge the almost-impossible odds faced by these pioneers and learn from their mistakes and failures.},

	abstract = {We study the effect of diversity in the physician workforce on the demand for preventive care among African-American men. Black men have the lowest life expectancy of any major demographic group in the U.S., and much of the disadvantage is due to chronic diseases which are amenable to primary and secondary prevention. In a field experiment in Oakland, California, we randomize black men to black or non-black male medical doctors and to incentives for one of the five offered preventives {\textemdash} the flu vaccine. We use a two-stage design, measuring decisions about cardiovascular screening and the flu vaccine before (ex ante) and after (ex post) meeting their assigned doctor. Black men select a similar number of preventives in the ex-ante stage, but are much more likely to select every preventive service, particularly invasive services, once meeting with a doctor who is the same race. The effects are most pronounced for men who mistrust the medical system and for those who experienced greater hassle costs associated with their visit. Subjects are more likely to talk with a black doctor about their health problems and black doctors are more likely to write additional notes about the subjects. The results are most consistent with better patient-doctor communication during the encounter rather than differential quality of doctors or discrimination. Our findings suggest black doctors could help reduce cardiovascular mortality by 16 deaths per 100,000 per year {\textemdash} leading to a 19\% reduction in the black-white male gap in cardiovascular mortality.},

	abstract = {The pleasures of life are worth nothing if one is not alive to experience them. Through the twentieth century in the United States and other high-income countries, growth in real incomes was accompanied by a historically unprecedented decline in mortality rates that caused life expectancy at birth to grow by nearly 30 years. In the years just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between countries were falling across the world. Poor countries enjoyed rapid increases in life-expectancy through the 1970s, with the gains in some cases exceeding an additional year of life expectancy per year, though the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the transition in Russia and Eastern Europe have changed that situation. We investigate the determinants of the historical decline in mortality, of differences in mortality across countries, and of differences in mortality across groups within countries. A good theory of mortality should explain all of the facts we will outline. No such theory exists at present, but at the end of the paper we will sketch a tentative synthesis.},

	abstract = {Variation in health care utilization is large and exists both across geographic regions and across doctors in the same region. However, the literature is only just beginning to understand the drivers of such variation. Are doctors prescribing different care for the same types of patients or are patients different in ways unobservable to researchers? This paper estimates the share of variation in physician practice intensity that is due to doctor differences as opposed to patient differences. The quasi-experiment leverages changes in the referral network of primary care physicians resulting from specialist migrations and exits. Using Medicare claims data, I estimate that between 50\% and 70\% of variation is driven by doctor styles. I replicate the baseline results using an instrumental variables strategy, suggesting that identification is robust to the most-likely endogeneity threats. Higher or lower health care usage is not correlated with mortality or hospitalization rates, but higher initial utilization does lead to greater subsequent utilization. In contrast to past studies, I estimate the treatment effect of doctors, rather than the treatment effect of geographic regions. Since doctors are the key decision-makers in health care provision and since variation across doctors vastly exceeds variation across regions, understanding the causal effect of doctors is vital for understanding the sources of variation and for designing policies to reduce that variation.},

I develop tractable instrumental variable quality estimators that accommodate nonlinear causal effects, institutional comparative advantage, and selection-on-gains. I use this framework to compute empirical Bayes posteriors for U.S. hospital quality that optimally combine estimates from quasi-experimental ambulance company assignment and predictions from observational risk-adjustment models (RAMs). Higher-spending, higher-volume, and privately-owned hospitals have better posteriors, and most markets exhibit positive selection-on-gains. I quantify the effects of selection bias by simulating Medicare reimbursement and consumer guidance policies that use quality posteriors instead of RAMs. The types of hospitals subsidized by performance-linked payment schemes are largely unchanged when quasiexperimental data is incorporated, but existing transfers are magnified. Admission policy simulations highlight the limitations of consumer guidance programs in settings with significant selection on match-specific quality.},

In the decade following an organizational transformation, the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system achieved substantial improvements in quality of care with minimal racial disparities for most process-of-care measures, such as rates of cholesterol screenings. However, in our study we observed a striking disconnect between high levels of performance on widely used process measures and modest levels of improvement in clinical outcomes, such as control of blood pressure, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels. We also observed a gap in clinical outcomes of as much as nine percentage points between African American veterans and white veterans. Almost all of the disparity in outcomes in the VA was explained by within-facility disparity, which suggests that VA medical centers need to measure and address racial gaps in care for their patient populations. Moreover, because cardiovascular disease and diabetes are major contributors to racial disparities in life expectancy, the findings of this study and others underscore the urgency of focused efforts to improve intermediate outcomes among African Americans in the VA and other settings.},

In the Medicare managed care program, broad improvements in quality have been accompanied by reduced racial gaps in processes of care, but substantial disparities in outcomes have persisted.ObjectivesTo assess variations among Medicare health plans in overall quality and racial disparity in 4 Health Plan Employer and Data Information Set (HEDIS) outcome measures, to determine whether high-performing plans exhibit smaller racial disparities, and to identify plans with high quality and low disparity.Design, Setting, and PatientsWe assessed the relationship between quality and racial disparity using multilevel multivariable regression models. The study sample included 431 573 individual-level observations in 151 Medicare health plans from 2002 to 2004.Main Outcome MeasuresHemoglobin A1c of less than 9.5\% or less than 9.0\% for enrollees with diabetes; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 130 mg/dL for enrollees with diabetes or after a coronary event; and blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg for enrollees with hypertension.ResultsClinical performance on HEDIS outcome measures was 6.8\% to 14.4\% lower for black enrollees than for white enrollees (P\&lt;.001 for all). For each measure, more than 70\% of this disparity was due to different outcomes for black and white individuals enrolled in the same health plan rather than selection of black enrollees into lower-performing plans. Health plans varied substantially in both overall quality and racial disparity on each of the 4 outcome measures. Adjusted correlations between overall quality and racial disparity were small and not statistically significant, ranging from 0.01 (blood pressure control) to -0.21 (cholesterol control in diabetes). Only 1 health plan achieved both high quality and low disparity on more than 1 measure.ConclusionsIn Medicare health plans, disparities vary widely and are only weakly correlated with the overall quality of care. Therefore, plan-specific performance reports of racial disparities on outcome measures would provide useful information not currently conveyed by standard HEDIS reports.},

Method: A personbased data set was created from Medicaid administrative data for fiscal year 1991 from the state of Maryland to yield the following: (1) estimates of prevalence of prescription recipients per 100 eligible enrollees; (2) relative prescription use ratios according to race (African-American versus Caucasian); and (3) the interrelation of race and geographic region on prescription prevalence. Results: Five major findings were observed: (1) African-American youths with Medicaid insurance aged 5 through 14 were less than half (39\% to 52\%) as likely to have been prescribed psychotropic medications as Caucasian youths with Medicaid insurance; (2) the relative difference for nonpsychotropic medication classes was much less pronounced: African-American youths were prescribed nonpsychotropic medications at a rate 60\% to 87\% of the Caucasian youths' rate; (3) the stimulants (essentially methylphenidate) had the most disparate AfricanAmerican/Caucasian ratio (1:2.5); (4) the racial disparity for psychotropics was not altered by partial (noncontinuous enrollment) eligibility status; and (5) although geographic variation reduced the racial disparity, the substantial racial difference (1:2.0) remained.

Whether managed care could reduce racial disparities in the use of preventive services is not known.ObjectiveTo determine whether the magnitude of racial disparity in influenza vaccination is smaller among managed care enrollees than among those with fee-for-service insurance.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThe 1996 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey of a US cohort of 13 674 African American and white Medicare beneficiaries with managed care and fee-for-service insurance.Main Outcome MeasuresPercentage of respondents (adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, clinical comorbid conditions, and care-seeking attitudes) who received influenza vaccination and magnitude of racial disparity in influenza vaccination, compared among those with managed care and fee-for-service insurance.ResultsEight percent of the beneficiaries were African American and 11\% were enrolled in managed care. Overall, 65.8\% received influenza vaccination. Whites were substantially more likely to be vaccinated than African Americans (67.7\% vs 46.1\%; absolute disparity, 21.6\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 18.2\%-25.0\%). Managed care enrollees were more likely than those with fee-for-service insurance to receive influenza vaccination (71.2\% vs 65.4\%; difference, 5.8\%; 95\% CI, 3.6\%-8.3\%). The adjusted racial disparity in fee-for-service was 24.9\% (95\% CI, 19.6\%-30.1\%) and in managed care was 18.6\% (95\% CI, 9.8\%-27.4\%). These adjusted racial disparities were both statistically significant, but the absolute percentage point difference in racial disparity between the 2 insurance groups (6.3\%; 95\% CI, {\textendash}4.6\% to 17.2\%) was not.ConclusionManaged care is associated with higher rates of influenza vaccination for both whites and African Americans, but racial disparity in vaccination is not reduced in managed care. Our results suggest that additional efforts are needed to adequately address this disparity.},

Using a multilevel analytical framework, we assess the extent of geographic variation in black/white disparities in self-rated health across US metropolitan areas, and whether racial residential segregation accounts for such variation. We estimated multilevel regression models of poor self-rated health among 51,316 non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black adults nested within 207 metropolitan areas to assess the multilevel relationship between segregation and racial disparities in health. We found statistically significant variation in the black/white disparity in poor self-rated health across metropolitan areas, after controlling for individual level factors (age, sex, marital status, education and income) and residential segregation. High black isolation was associated with increased odds of reporting poor health among blacks (po0:05). While a similar pattern was observed for white/black dissimilarity and white isolation, they were not statistically significant. Our multilevel analysis only partially supports the previously reported aggregate findings linking segregation to health. Additional multilevel statistical investigations across different health outcomes are required to draw firmer conclusions regarding the adverse effects of segregation on health.},

	abstract = {The United States' black/white health gap is an important consequence of racial inequality. The gap is large, shows little signs of declining, and explanations have been limited by lack of theory and data. A new direction that offers potential for theoretical development is a focus on black immigrants, a group that shares the same racial status as U.S.-born blacks but experiences significantly better health. Using new data on the 2000-2002 National Health Interview Surveys, we disaggregate black immigrants by region of birth and develop a thesis that emphasizes the interplay of selectivity and racial context of origin for understanding health disparities among black Americans, namely that majority white contexts have deleterious health effects. The results indicate thatgrouping together foreignborn blacks conceals important health differentials among this population. Compared to U.S. -bom blacks, black immigrants Erom minority white (Africa, South America) and racially mixed (West Indies) regions have superior health, while those from majority white (Europe) regions fare no better. A similar gradient exists among black immigrants, with Africans faring the best, followed by South Americans, then West Indians, with European blacks having the poorest health. Though these findings are not the definitive test of our theory, they are suggestive. They point us to understanding the mechanisme in the United States {\textemdash} racial context {\textemdash} that worsen the health and well being of black Americans, foreignand native-born alike.},

	abstract = {The relative contribution of genetic and environmental influences to the US black-white disparity in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is hotly debated within the public health, anthropology, and medical communities. In this article, we review evidence for developmental and epigenetic pathways linking early life environments with CVD, and critically evaluate their possible role in the origins of these racial health disparities. African Americans not only suffer from a disproportionate burden of CVD relative to whites, but also have higher rates of the perinatal health disparities now known to be the antecedents of these conditions. There is extensive evidence for a social origin to prematurity and low birth weight in African Americans, reflecting pathways such as the effects of discrimination on maternal stress physiology. In light of the inverse relationship between birth weight and adult CVD, there is now a strong rationale to consider developmental and epigenetic mechanisms as links between early life environmental factors like maternal stress during pregnancy and adult race-based health disparities in diseases like hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and coronary heart disease. The model outlined here builds upon social constructivist perspectives to highlight an important set of mechanisms by which social influences can become embodied, having durable and even transgenerational influences on the most pressing US health disparities. We conclude that environmentally responsive phenotypic plasticity, in combination with the better-studied acute and chronic effects of social-environmental exposures, provides a more parsimonious explanation than genetics for the persistence of CVD disparities between members of socially imposed racial categories.

	abstract = {Background. Black women are particularly vulnerable to obesity, with a prevalence rate of {\textgreater}50\%. The higher mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes have been attributed, in part, to their obesity. In recent years, a particular public health concern is the increasing secular trend in obesity with an even greater racial disparity, especially in girls and women. Between the early 1960s and late 1980s, the prevalence of obesity tripled in young black girls 6 to 11 years of age, while it doubled in white girls. Similarly, both overweight and obesity in adolescent girls 12 to 17 years of age also increased, with a greater increase again seen in adolescent black girls. This secular trend in obesity with a greater increase in black girls signals a potentially grave future chronic disease burden on black women, which is already higher than in white women. The increasing occurrence in children and adolescents of noninsulin-dependent diabetes, traditionally viewed as an adult-onset condition, may be a consequence of the currently high prevalence of obesity in American youth. Not surprisingly, this condition is seen more frequently among black youths.},

	abstract = {It is well known that there is a significant racial divide in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates. African American women are less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than white women but are more likely to die from it. This review explores the factors that may contribute to the racial survival disparity. Consideration is paid to what is known about the role of differences in tumor biology, genomics, cancer screening, and quality of cancer care. It is argued that it is the collision of 2 forces, tumor biology and genomics, with patterns of care that leads to the breast cancer mortality gap. The delays, misuse, and underuse of treatment for African American patients are of increased significance when these patients are presenting with more aggressive forms of breast cancer. In the current climate of health care reform ushered in by the Affordable Care Act, this article also evaluates interventions to close the disparity gap. Prior interventions have been too narrowly focused on the patient rather than addressing the system and improving care across the continuum of breast cancer evaluation and treatment. Lastly, areas of future investigation and policy initiatives aimed at reducing the racial survival disparity in breast cancer are discussed.

Using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I and the subsequent follow-up interviews, this research examines health disparities between white and black adults and whether the SES/health gradient differs across the two groups in the USA. Two competing mechanisms for the conditional or interactive relationship between race and SES on health are examined during a 20-year period for black and white Americans. Results show that black adults began the study with more serious illnesses and poorer self-rated health than white adults and that the disparity continued over the 20 years. Significant interactions were found between race and education as well as race and employment status on health outcomes. The interaction effect of race and education showed that the racial disparity in self-rated health was largest at the higher levels of SES, providing some evidence for the {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}diminishing returns{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} hypothesis; as education levels increased, black adults did not have the same improvement in self-rated health as white adults. Overall, the findings provide evidence for the continuing significance of both race and SES in determining health status over time.},

Although this measure is not a good proxy for inequality within the bottom half of the income distribution, it is a good proxy for changes in the top half of the distribution and for the Gini coefficient. In the absence of country and year fixed effects, the income share of the top decile is negatively related to life expectancy and positively related to infant mortality. However, in our preferred fixed-effects specification these relationships are weak, statistically insignificant, and likely to change their sign. Nor do our data suggest that changes in the income share of the richest 10\% affect homicide or suicide rates.},

By contrast, in recent years more robust statistical methods using larger and richer data sources have generally pointed to little or no relationship between inequality and mortality. This paper aims both to document how methodological shortcomings tend to positively bias this statistical association and to advance this literature by estimating the inequality-mortality relationship. We use a comprehensive and rich new data set that combines U.S. county-level data for 1990 and 2000 on age-race-gender-specific mortality rates, a rich set of observable covariates, and previously unused Census data on local income inequality (Gini index and three income percentile ratios). Using panel data estimation techniques, we find evidence of a statistically significant negative relationship between mortality and inequality. This finding that increased inequality is associated with declines in mortality at the county level suggests a change in course for the literature. In particular, the emphasis to date on the potential psychosocial and resource allocation costs associated with higher inequality is likely missing important offsetting positives that may dominate.},

	abstract = {Summary
Income inequality in the USA has increased over the past four decades. Socioeconomic gaps in survival have also increased. Life expectancy has risen among middle-income and high-income Americans whereas it has stagnated among poor Americans and even declined in some demographic groups. Although the increase in income inequality since 1980 has been driven largely by soaring top incomes, the widening of survival inequalities has occurred lower in the distribution{\textemdash}ie, between the poor and upper-middle class. Growing survival gaps across income percentiles since 2001 reflect falling real incomes among poor Americans as well as an increasingly strong association between low income and poor health. Changes in individual risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and substance abuse play a part but do not fully explain the steeper gradient. Distal factors correlated with rising inequality including unequal access to technological innovations, increased geographical segregation by income, reduced economic mobility, mass incarceration, and increased exposure to the costs of medical care might have reduced access to salutary determinants of health among low-income Americans. Having missed out on decades of income growth and longevity gains, low-income Americans are increasingly left behind. Without interventions to decouple income and health, or to reduce inequalities in income, we might see the emergence of a 21st century health-poverty trap and the further widening and hardening of socioeconomic inequalities in health.},

There were 4 114 380 deaths among men (mortality rate, 596.3 per 100 000) and 2 694 808 deaths among women (mortality rate, 375.1 per 100 000). The analysis yielded 4 results. First, higher income was associated with greater longevity throughout the income distribution. The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1\% and poorest 1\% of individuals was 14.6 years (95\% CI, 14.4 to 14.8 years) for men and 10.1 years (95\% CI, 9.9 to 10.3 years) for women. Second, inequality in life expectancy increased over time. Between 2001 and 2014, life expectancy increased by 2.34 years for men and 2.91 years for women in the top 5\% of the income distribution, but by only 0.32 years for men and 0.04 years for women in the bottom 5\% (\textit{P} \&lt; .001 for the differences for both sexes). Third, life expectancy for low-income individuals varied substantially across local areas. In the bottom income quartile, life expectancy differed by approximately 4.5 years between areas with the highest and lowest longevity. Changes in life expectancy between 2001 and 2014 ranged from gains of more than 4 years to losses of more than 2 years across areas. Fourth, geographic differences in life expectancy for individuals in the lowest income quartile were significantly correlated with health behaviors such as smoking (\textit{r} = -0.69,\textit{P} \&lt; .001), but were not significantly correlated with access to medical care, physical environmental factors, income inequality, or labor market conditions. Life expectancy for low-income individuals was positively correlated with the local area fraction of immigrants (\textit{r} = 0.72,\textit{P} \&lt; .001), fraction of college graduates (\textit{r} = 0.42,\textit{P} \&lt; .001), and government expenditures (\textit{r} = 0.57,\textit{P} \&lt; .001).{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Conclusions and Relevance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}In the United States between 2001 and 2014, higher income was associated with greater longevity, and differences in life expectancy across income groups increased over time.

We assessed the extent to which living in racially segregated areas and living in geographic proximity to low-quality hospitals contribute to this disparity. Using national Medicare data for all patients who underwent one of three high-risk surgical procedures in 2005{\textendash}08, we found that black patients actually tended to live closer to higher-quality hospitals than white patients did but were 25{\textendash}58 percent more likely than whites to receive surgery at low-quality hospitals. Racial segregation was also a factor, with black patients in the most segregrated areas 41{\textendash}96 percent more likely than white patients to undergo surgery at low-quality hospitals. To address these disparities, care navigators and public reporting of comparative quality could steer patients and their referring physicians to higher-quality hospitals, while quality improvement efforts could focus on improving outcomes for high-risk surgery at hospitals that disproportionately serve black patients. Unfortunately, existing policies such as pay-for-performance, bundled payments, and nonpayment for adverse events may divert resources and exacerbate these disparities.},

Building on recent research which documents the existence of a national naming pattern for African American males in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Cook, Logan and Parman, 2014), we analyze long-term consequences of distinctively racialized names. Using over 3 million death certificates from Alabama, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina from 1802 to 1970, we find a robust within-race mortality difference for African American men who had distinctively black names. Having an African American name added more than 1 year of life relative to other African American males. The result is robust to controlling for the age pattern of mortality over time and environmental factors which could drive the mortality relationship. The result is not consistently present for infant and child mortality, however. As much as 10\% of the historical between-race mortality gap would have been closed if every black man was given a black name. Suggestive evidence implies that cultural factors not captured by socioeconomic or human capital measures may be related to the mortality differential.},

We use a newly developed measure of historical racial residential segregation based on individual-level data. The measure exploits complete census manuscript files to identify the races of next-door neighbors. This measure is the first and only measure of historical segregation for rural communities, allowing us to greatly extend the empirical analysis of the effects of racial segregation on health over space and time. Using this comprehensive measure of racial residential segregation, we estimate the historical relationship between racial segregation and mortality. We find that conditional on racial composition, racially segregated environments had higher mortality rates and it was not always the case that the outcomes for blacks were worse than those of whites. These effects of segregation on health differed between urban and rural locations. We conclude by noting how comprehensive measures of segregation can extend the analysis of structural factors in racial health disparities to rural residents and to the historical evolution of health disparities.},

However, few studies have related differences in the quality of interpersonal care to patient and physician race and gender.ObjectiveTo describe how the race/ethnicity and gender of patients and physicians are associated with physicians' participatory decision-making (PDM) styles.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsTelephone survey conducted between November 1996 and June 1998 of 1816 adults aged 18 to 65 years (mean age, 41 years) who had recently attended 1 of 32 primary care practices associated with a large mixed-model managed care organization in an urban setting. Sixty-six percent of patients surveyed were female, 43\% were white, and 45\% were African American. The physician sample (n=64) was 63\% male, with 56\% white, and 25\% African American.Main Outcome MeasurePatients' ratings of their physicians' PDM style on a 100-point scale.ResultsAfrican American patients rated their visits as significantly less participatory than whites in models adjusting for patient age, gender, education, marital status, health status, and length of the patient-physician relationship (mean [SE] PDM score, 58.0 [1.2] vs 60.6 [3.3]; P=.03). Ratings of minority and white physicians did not differ with respect to PDM style (adjusted mean [SE] PDM score for African Americans, 59.2 [1.7] vs whites, 61.7 [3.1]; P=.13). Patients in race-concordant relationships with their physicians rated their visits as significantly more participatory than patients in race-discordant relationships (difference [SE], 2.6 [1.1]; P=.02). Patients of female physicians had more participatory visits (adjusted mean [SE] PDM score for female, 62.4 [1.3] vs male, 59.5 [3.1]; P=.03), but gender concordance between physicians and patients was not significantly related to PDM score (unadjusted mean [SE] PDM score, 76.0 [1.0] for concordant vs 74.5 [0.9] for discordant; P=.12). Patient satisfaction was highly associated with PDM score within all race/ethnicity groups.ConclusionsOur data suggest that African American patients rate their visits with physicians as less participatory than whites. However, patients seeing physicians of their own race rate their physicians' decision-making styles as more participatory. Improving cross-cultural communication between primary care physicians and patients and providing patients with access to a diverse group of physicians may lead to more patient involvement in care, higher levels of patient satisfaction, and better health outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African-American patients who visit physicians of the same race rate their medical visits as more satisfying and participatory than do those who see physicians of other races. Little research has investigated the communication process in race-concordant and race-discordant medical visits.
OBJECTIVES: To compare patient-physician communication in race-concordant and race-discordant visits and examine whether communication behaviors explain differences in patient ratings of satisfaction and participatory decision making.
DESIGN: Cohort study with follow-up using previsit and postvisit surveys and audiotape analysis.
SETTING: 16 urban primary care practices.
PATIENTS: 252 adults (142 African-American patients and 110 white patients) receiving care from 31 physicians (of whom 18 were African-American and 13 were white).
MEASUREMENTS: Audiotape measures of patient-centeredness, patient ratings of physicians' participatory decision-making styles, and overall satisfaction.
RESULTS: Race-concordant visits were longer (2.15 minutes [95\% CI, 0.60 to 3.71]) and had higher ratings of patient positive affect (0.55 point, [95\% CI, 0.04 to 1.05]) compared with race-discordant visits. Patients in race-concordant visits were more satisfied and rated their physicians as more participatory (8.42 points [95\% CI, 3.23 to 13.60]). Audiotape measures of patient-centered communication behaviors did not explain differences in participatory decision making or satisfaction between race-concordant and race-discordant visits.
CONCLUSIONS: Race-concordant visits are longer and characterized by more patient positive affect. Previous studies link similar communication findings to continuity of care. The association between race concordance and higher patient ratings of care is independent of patient-centered communication, suggesting that other factors, such as patient and physician attitudes, may mediate the relationship. Until more evidence is available regarding the mechanisms of this relationship and the effectiveness of intercultural communication skills programs, increasing ethnic diversity among physicians may be the most direct strategy to improve health care experiences for members of ethnic minority groups.},

	abstract = {We examined a national sample of African-American, white, Hispanic, and Asian-American respondents to test the hypothesis that when patients are race concordant with their physicians, they are more likely to utilize health services. The analysis used the 1994 Commonwealth Fund Minority Health Survey to construct a series of multivariate models. Using three dimensions of health services utilization, we found support for the hypothesis. Compared to patients whose regular doctors are of a different race, patients who are of the same racial or ethnic group as their physicians were more likely to use needed health services (OR=.62; 95\% CI .46, .81); were less likely to postpone or delay seeking care (OR=.78; 95\% CI .65, .94); and reported a higher volume of use of health services (OR=2.68; 95\% CI 2.07, 3.45). Analysis within race-specific sub-samples found this pattern to be most consistent among white and African-Americans and less prevalent among Hispanic and Asian-Americans. Adjusting the models for health status and a variety of other known predictors of health care utilization did not substantially affect the relationship between doctor-patient race concordance and health services use.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of patient-provider sex, race/ethnicity, and dual concordance with healthcare measures.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Analyses of data from adult respondents indicating a usual source of healthcare (N=22,440) in the 2002 to 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (each a 2-year panel).
MEASURES: Year 1 provider communication, sex-neutral (colorectal cancer screening, influenza vaccination) and sex-specific (mammography, Papanicolaou smear, prostate-specific antigen) prevention; and year 2 health status (SF-12). Analyses adjusted for patient sociodemographics and health variables, and healthcare provider (usual source of care) sex and race/ethnicity.
RESULTS: Of 24 concordance assessments, 3 were statistically significant. Women with female providers were more likely to report mammography adherence [average adjusted marginal effect=3.9\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.6\%, 6.2\%; P{\textless}0.01]. Respondents reporting dual concordance were less likely to rate provider communication in the highest quartile (average adjusted marginal effect =-4.2\%, 95\% CI: -8.1\%, -0.2\%; P=0.04), but dual concordance was associated with higher adjusted SF-12 Physical Component Summary scores (0.58 points, 95\% CI: 0.00, 1.15; P=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence of clinical benefit resulting from sex or race/ethnicity concordance was found. Greater matching of patients and providers by sex and race/ethnicity is unlikely to mitigate health disparities.},

	abstract = {Purpose
The authors conducted a systematic review of the medical literature to determine the factors most strongly associated with localizing primary care physicians (PCPs) in underserved urban and rural areas of the United States.

Method
In November 2015, the authors searched databases (MEDLINE, ERIC, SCOPUS) and Google Scholar to identify published peer-reviewed studies that focused on PCPs and reported practice location outcomes that included U.S. underserved urban or rural areas. Studies focusing on practice intentions, non-physicians, patient panel composition, or retention/turnover were excluded. They screened 4,130 titles and reviewed 284 full-text articles.

Results
Seventy-two observational or case-control studies met inclusion criteria. These were categorized into four broad themes aligned with prior literature: 19 studies focused on physician characteristics, 13 on financial factors, 20 on medical school curricula/programs, and 20 on graduate medical education (GME) programs. Studies found significant relationships between physician race/ethnicity and language and practice in underserved areas. Multiple studies demonstrated significant associations between financial factors (e.g., debt or incentives) and underserved or rural practice, independent of preexisting trainee characteristics. There was also evidence that medical school and GME programs were effective in training PCPs who locate in underserved areas.

Conclusions
Both financial incentives and special training programs could be used to support trainees with the personal characteristics associated with practicing in underserved or rural areas. Expanding and replicating medical school curricula and programs proven to produce clinicians who practice in underserved urban and rural areas should be a strategic investment for medical education and future research.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of patient race/ethnicity and language and patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance on medication adherence rates for a large cohort of diabetes patients in an integrated delivery system.
DESIGN: We studied 131,277 adult diabetes patients in Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2005. Probit models assessed the effect of patient and physician race/ethnicity and language on adherence to CVD medications, after controlling for patient and physician characteristics.
RESULTS: Ten percent of African American, 11 \% of Hispanic, 63\% of Asian, and 47\% of white patients had same race/ethnicity physicians. 24\% of Spanish-speaking patients were linguistically concordant with their physicians. African American (46\%), Hispanic (49\%) and Asian (52\%) patients were significantly less likely than white patients (58\%) to be in good adherence to all of their CVD medications (p{\textless}0.001). Spanish-speaking patients were less likely than English speaking patients to be in good adherence (51\% versus 57\%, p{\textless}0.001). Race concordance for African American patients was associated with adherence to all their CVD medications (53\% vs. 50\%, p{\textless}0.05). Language concordance was associated with medication adherence for Spanish-speaking patients (51\% vs. 45\%, p{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSION: Increasing opportunities for patient-physician race/ethnicity and language concordance may improve medication adherence for African American and Spanish-speaking patients, though a similar effect was not observed for Asian patients or English-proficient Hispanic patients.},

Results{\textemdash} Within-hospital analyses narrowed or erased black-white disparities for medical treatments received during the acute hospitalization, widened black-white disparities for follow-up surgical treatments, and augmented the survival advantage among blacks. These findings indicate that, on average, blacks went to hospitals that had lower rates of evidence-based medical treatments, higher rates of cardiac procedures, and worse risk-adjusted mortality after AMI.
Conclusions{\textemdash} Incorporating the hospital effect altered the findings of racial disparity analyses in AMI and explained more of the disparities than race. A policy of targeted hospital-level interventions may be required for success of national efforts to reduce disparities.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES We assessed use of low-volume hospitals by race and ethnicity for major cardiovascular procedures and determined whether hospital volume is an important factor explaining racial and ethnic differences in post-procedure mortality.
BACKGROUND Low hospital volume predicts mortality for cardiovascular procedures and could be a mediator of racial and ethnic differences in procedure outcomes.
METHODS We analyzed data from 719,679 hospitalizations for cardiac artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair, and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) from 1998 to 2001 using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess whether race predicts use of low-volume hospitals and the relative contribution of hospital volume to racial disparity in post-procedure in-hospital mortality.
RESULTS Black and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to receive cardiovascular procedures in low-volume hospitals. Black patients had greater risk-adjusted mortality than white patients after elective AAA repair (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 2.84), CABG (OR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.33), and CEA (OR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.07 to 2.27), but not PTCA. Hispanic patients did not have higher risk-adjusted mortality than white patients. Adjusting for hospital volume did not substantially reduce the relative risk of death for black patients compared with white patients.
CONCLUSIONS Black and Hispanic patients were more likely to receive cardiovascular procedures in low-volume hospitals, but hospital volume did not explain a large proportion of racial differences in post-procedure mortality. Additional research is needed to determine why black patients have increased mortality after cardiovascular procedures and how these mortality rates can be reduced.

	abstract = {Purpose Black patients have worse prognoses than whites with breast or colorectal cancer. Mechanisms underlying such disparities have not been fully explored. We examined the role of hospital factors in racial differences in late mortality after surgery for breast or colon cancer.
Methods Patients undergoing surgery after new diagnosis of breast or colon cancer were identified using the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results{\textendash}Medicare linked database (1995 to 2005). The main outcome measure was mortality at 5 years. Proportional hazards models were used to assess relationships between race and late mortality, accounting for patient factors, socioeconomic measures, and hospital factors. Fixed and random effects models were used to account for quality differences across hospitals.
Results Black patients, compared with white patients, had lower 5-year overall survival rates after surgery for breast (62.1\% v 70.4\%, respectively; P ? .001) and colon cancer (41.3\% v 45.4\%, respectively; P ? .001). After controlling for age, comorbidity, and stage, black race remained an independent predictor of mortality for breast (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] ? 1.25; 95\% CI, 1.16 to 1.34) and colon cancer (adjusted HR ? 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.07 to 1.19). After risk adjustment, hospital factors explained 36\% and 54\% of the excess mortality for black patients with breast cancer and colon cancer, respectively. Hospitals with large minority populations had higher late mortality rates independent of race.
Conclusion Hospital factors, including quality, are important mediators of the association between race and mortality for breast and colon cancer. Hospital-level quality improvement should be a major component of efforts to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background: Ethnic/racial minorities experience poorer outcomes from lung cancer than non-Hispanic whites. Higher hospital procedure volume is associated with better survival from lung resection for lung cancer. Objectives: We examined whether (1) ethnic/racial minorities are more likely to obtain lung resections at lower volume hospitals, (2) ethnicity/race is associated with inpatient mortality, (3) hospital volume mediates this association, and (4) hospital selection is mediated by racial/ethnic segregation, differences in insurance coverage, or limited hospital choice. Methods: Six years of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS 1998-2003, unweighted n = 50,245, weighted n = 129,506) were used in multivariate models controlling for sociodemographic factors, case complexity, and hospital characteristics. Additional analyses were conducted using the Area Resource File, which provided data on ethnic density and number of surgical hospitals in the hospital region. Results: Blacks/African Americans (odds ratio [OR] = 0.45; 0.34-0.58) and Latinos ( OR = 0.44; 0.32-0.63) had lower odds of obtaining lung resection at a high-volume hospital than non- Hispanic whites. Blacks/African Americans (OR = 1.30; 1.01-1.67), Latinos (OR = 1.41; 1.02- 1.94), and other racial/ethnic minorities (OR = 1.46; 1.04-2.06) also had higher odds of dying in hospital, but this association was statistically nonsignificant after controlling for hospital volume. Hospital location was not associated with lung resection procedure volume, nor did location mediate the association between ethnicity/race and hospital volume. Conclusions: Ethnic/racial minorities are obtaining lung resection in lower volume hospitals and are more likely to die in hospital. Hospital volume is associated with higher mortality, but health insurance, segregation, and number of surgical hospitals within a county do not account for observed disparities.},

	abstract = {Objective: To understand whether racial disparities in surgery for lowerextremity arterial disease are minimized by high-quality providers, or instead, differential treatment of otherwise similar patients pervades all settings. Summary Background Data: Black patients are substantially more likely than whites to undergo amputation rather than revascularization for lowerextremity arterial disease. Because their care is disproportionately concentrated among a small share of providers, some have attributed such disparities to the quality and capacity of these sites.
Methods: We evaluated all 86,865 white or black fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 65 and older who underwent major lower-extremity vascular procedures. Using generalized linear mixed models with random effects, we computed risk-adjusted odds of amputation by race overall, and after serial substratification by salient patient and provider characteristics.
Results: Blacks were far more likely to undergo amputation (45\% vs. 20\%). Their procedures were performed more often by nonspecialists (41\% vs. 27\%; P ? 0.001), in low-volume hospitals (40\% vs. 32\%; P ? 0.001), with high amputation rates (53\% vs. 29\%; P ? 0.001). Controlling for differences in comorbidity, disease severity, and surgeon and hospital performance, blacks{\textquoteright} odds of amputation remained 1.7 times greater (95\% confidence interval: 1.6 {\textendash}1.9). Even among highest-performing providers{\textemdash}vascular specialists in high-volume, urban teaching hospitals with angioplasty facilities{\textemdash}racial gaps persisted (risk-adjusted amputation rates: 7\% for blacks vs. 4\% for whites, P ? 0.001; odds ratio: 1.8, 95\% confidence interval: 1.5{\textendash}2.1).
Conclusions: Black patients with critical limb ischemia face significantly higher risk of major amputation, even when treated by providers with highest likelihoods of revascularization. Increased referral to high-performing providers might increase limb-preservation, but cannot eliminate disparities until equitable treatment can be ensured in all settings.},

	abstract = {A necessary condition for competition to promote quality in hospital markets is that patients are sensitive to differences in hospital quality. In this paper we examine the relationship between hospital quality, as measured by publicly available quality ratings, and patient hospital choice for angioplasty using individual claims data from a large health insurer. We find that Dutch patients have a high propensity to choose hospitals with a good reputation, both overall and for cardiology, and a low readmission rate after treatment for heart failure. Relative to a mean readmission rate of 8.5\% we find that a 1\%-point lower readmission rate is associated with a 12\% increase in hospital demand. Since readmission rates are not adjusted for case-mix they may not provide a correct signal of hospital quality. Insofar patients base their hospital choice on such imperfect quality information, this may result in suboptimal choices and risk selection by hospitals.},

	title = {Bayesian {Inference} for {Hospital} {Quality} in a {Selection} {Model}},
	abstract = {This paper develops new econometric methods to infer hospital quality in a model with discrete dependent variables and nonrandom selection. Mortality rates in patient discharge records are widely used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital admission is not random and some hospitals may attract patients with greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the assumption of random admission leads to spurious inference about hospital quality. This study controls for hospital selection using a model in which distance between the patient{\textquoteright}s residence and alternative hospitals are key exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulator, and attaches posterior probabilities to quality comparisons between individual hospitals and groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients admitted to 114 hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the smallest and largest hospitals to be of the highest quality. There is strong evidence of dependence between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients to hospitals, whereby patients with a high unobserved severity of illness are disproportionately admitted to high quality hospitals. Consequently a conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality that are markedly different from those in this study{\textquoteright}s selection model.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In April 2005 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services launched {\textquotedblleft}Hospital Compare,{\textquotedblright} the first government-sponsored hospital quality scorecard. We compared the ranking of U.S. News and World Report{\textquoteright}s {\textquotedblleft}Best Hospitals{\textquotedblright} with Hospital Compare performance ratings.
METHODS: We examined Hospital Compare scores for core measures related to care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We calculated composite scores for the disease-specific sets of core measures and a composite combined score for the 14 core measures (across 3 diseases) and determined national score quartile cut points for each set. We then characterized the quartile distribution of Hospital Compare scores for the Best Hospitals for care of cardiac conditions and respiratory disorders in each year, as well as for the Best Hospital {\textquotedblleft}Honor Roll{\textquotedblright} institutions.
RESULTS: AMI scores were available for 2165 hospitals, CHF scores for 3130, and CAP scores for 3462. In both 2004 and 2005, fewer than 50\% of the Best Hospitals for cardiac care rated in the top quartile of Hospital Compare scores for AMI and CHF. Among the Best Hospitals for care of respiratory disorders, fewer than 15\% scored in the top Hospital Compare quartile for CAP. Among Honor Roll institutions, only 5 (of 14 hospitals in 2004; of 16 in 2005) ranked in the top quartile for the combined core measure score.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospital Compare scores are frequently discordant with Best Hospital rankings, which is likely attributable to the markedly different methods each rating approach employs. Such discordance between major quality rating systems paints a conflicting picture of institutional performance for the public to interpret.

Methods: The 2013e2015 100\% Medicare Inpatient and Outpatient SAFs was utilized to identify patients who underwent surgery (AAA repair, CABG, THA, TKA and lung resection) at one of the top-20 hospitals ranked by USNWR.
Results: On multivariable linear regression analysis, after controlling for clinical and hospital level factors, rank position among the top 20 USNWR hospitals was not associated with the proportion of patients who experienced a complication (b {\textonequarter} 0.167), failure-to-rescue (b {\textonequarter} 0.277), 90-day readmission (b {\textonequarter} 0.186) and 90-day mortality (b {\textonequarter} 0.033)(all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Similar trends were observed among each surgical procedure type, as well as even among all top 50 USNWR ranked hospitals (all p {\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusion: Rank position among hospitals within the USNWR "honor roll" was not associated with differences in patient outcomes following surgical intervention. Patients and hospitals need to exercise caution when placing weight on rank-position among hospitals as a means to discriminate clinical outcomes and quality of actual patient care.},

In this paper, I propose an alternative approach: ranking hospitals on the basis of the travel distances of their Medicare patients.

I use data on elderly Medicare beneficiaries with heart attack and stroke from 1994 and 1999 to show that a distance report card would be both valid n that is, correlated with true quality n and able to distinguish confidently among hospitals n that is, able to reject at conventional significance levels the hypothesis that the true quality of a low-ranked hospital was the same as the quality of the average hospital. The hypothetical distance report card I propose compares favorably to (although does not necessarily dominate) the California AMI outcomes report card.},

In this article our objective was to assess readmission rates as a hospital quality measure. First we compared quartile rankings of hospitals based on readmission rates in 2009 and 2011 to see whether hospitals maintained their relative performance or whether shifts occurred that suggested either changes in quality or random variation. Next we examined the relationship between readmission rates and several commonly used hospital quality indicators, including risk-standardized mortality rates, volume, teaching status, and process-measure performance. We found that quartile rankings fluctuated and that readmission rates for lower-performing hospitals in 2009 tended to improve by 2011, while readmission rates for higher-performing hospitals tended to worsen. Regression to the mean (a form of statistical noise) accounted for a portion of the changes in hospital performance. We also found that readmission rates were higher in teaching hospitals and were weakly correlated with the other indicators of hospital quality. Policy makers should consider augmenting the use of readmission rates with other measures of hospital performance during care transitions and should build on current efforts that take a communitywide approach to the readmissions issue.},

The framework is motivated by an equivalence result: the orthogonality between a shift-share instrument and an unobserved residual can be represented as the orthogonality between the underlying shocks and a shock-level unobservable. SSIV regression coefficients can similarly be obtained from an equivalent shocklevel regression, motivating shock-level conditions for their consistency.

Using data on Medicare beneficiaries with a heart attack in the late 1980s and 17 years of follow up data, I evaluate the long-term costs and benefits of revascularization after a heart attack. I account for non-random selection into treatment with instrumental variables; following McClellan, McNeil, and Newhouse, the instrument is the differential distance to a hospital capable of providing revascularization. The results show that revascularization is associated with over 1 year of additional life expectancy, at a cost of about \$40,000. Revascularization, or other treatments correlated with it, appears to be highly cost-effective.},

	abstract = {This paper develops new econometric methods to infer hospital quality in a model with discrete dependent variables and nonrandom selection. Mortality rates in patient discharge records are widely used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital admission is not random and some hospitals may attract patients with greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the assumption of random admission leads to spurious inference about hospital quality. This study controls for hospital selection using a model in which distance between the patient's residence and alternative hospitals are key exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulator, and attaches posterior probabilities to quality comparisons between individual hospitals and groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients admitted to 114 hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the smallest and largest hospitals to be of the highest quality. There is strong evidence of dependence between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients to hospitals, whereby patients with a high unobserved severity of illness are disproportionately admitted to high quality hospitals. Consequently a conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality that are markedly different from those in this study's selection model.},

We report four facts. (1) Black patients receive care at lower-performing hospitals than white patients, even when they live in the same hospital market or ZIP code within a hospital market. (2) Over the past two decades, the gap in performance between hospitals treating Black and white patients shrank by over two-thirds. (3) This progress is due to more rapid performance improvement at hospitals that tended to treat Black patients, rather than faster reallocation of Black patients to better hospitals. (4) Hospital performance improvement is correlated with adoption of a high-return low-cost input, betablockers. Closing remaining disparities in allocation and harnessing the forces of performance improvement, including technology diffusion, may be novel levers to further reduce disparities.},

At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive.

            There is growing evidence that firm-specific pay premiums are an important source of wage inequality. These premiums will contribute to the gender wage gap if women are less likely to work at high-paying firms or if women negotiate (or are offered) worse wage bargains with their employers than men. Using longitudinal data on the hourly wages of Portuguese workers matched with income statement information for firms, we show that the wages of both men and women contain firm-specific premiums that are strongly correlated with simple measures of the potential bargaining surplus at each firm. We then show how the impact of these firm-specific pay differentials on the gender wage gap can be decomposed into a combination of sorting and bargaining effects. We find that women are less likely to work at firms that pay higher premiums to either gender, with sorting effects being most important for low- and middle-skilled workers. We also find that women receive only 90\% of the firm-specific pay premiums earned by men. Importantly, we find the same gender gap in the responses of wages to changes in potential surplus over time. Taken together, the combination of sorting and bargaining effects explain about one-fifth of the cross-sectional gender wage gap in Portugal.},

            We use a massive, matched employer-employee database for the United States to analyze the contribution of firms to the rise in earnings inequality from 1978 to 2013. We find that one-third of the rise in the variance of (log) earnings occurred within firms, whereas two-thirds of the rise occurred due to a rise in the dispersion of average earnings between firms. However, this rising between-firm variance is not accounted for by the firms themselves but by a widening gap between firms in the composition of their workers. This compositional change can be split into two roughly equal parts: high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work in high-wage firms (i.e., sorting increased), and high-wage workers became increasingly likely to work with each other (i.e., segregation rose). In contrast, we do not find a rise in the variance of firm-specific pay once we control for the worker composition in firms. Finally, we find that two-thirds of the rise in the within-firm variance of earnings occurred within mega (10,000+ employee) firms, which saw a particularly large increase in the variance of earnings compared with smaller firms.},

	abstract = {Empirical researchers often combine multiple instrumental variables (IVs) for a single treatment using two-stage least squares (2SLS). When treatment effects are heterogeneous, a common justification for including multiple IVs is that the 2SLS estimand can be given a causal interpretation as a positively-weighted average of local average treatment effects (LATEs). This justification requires the well-known monotonicity condition. However, we show that with more than one instrument, this condition can only be satisfied if choice behavior is effectively homogenous. Based on this finding, we consider the use of multiple IVs under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition. We characterize empirically verifiable sufficient and necessary conditions for the 2SLS estimand to be a positively-weighted average of LATEs under partial monotonicity. We apply these results to an empirical analysis of the returns to college with multiple instruments. We show that the standard monotonicity condition is at odds with the data. Nevertheless, our empirical checks show that the 2SLS estimate retains a causal interpretation as a positively-weighted average of the effects of college attendance among complier groups.},

	abstract = {Many studies use matched employer-employee data to estimate a statistical model of earnings determination where log-earnings are expressed as the sum of worker effects, firm effects, covariates, and idiosyncratic error terms. Estimates based on this model have produced two influential yet controversial conclusions. First, firm effects typically explain around 20\% of the variance of log-earnings, pointing to the importance of firm-specific wage-setting for earnings inequality. Second, the correlation between firm and worker effects is often small and sometimes negative, indicating little if any sorting of highwage workers to high-paying firms. The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of these conclusions to the biases that arise because of limited mobility of workers across firms. We use employer-employee data from the US and several European countries while taking advantage of both fixed-effects and random-effects methods for bias-correction. We find that limited mobility bias is severe and that bias-correction is important. Once one corrects for limited mobility bias, firm effects dispersion matters less for earnings inequality and worker sorting becomes always positive and typically strong.},

	abstract = {Background Despite numerous studies of geographic variation in healthcare cost and utilization at the local, regional, and state levels across the U.S., a comprehensive characterization of geographic variation in outcomes has not been published. Our objective was to quantify variation in US health outcomes in an all-payer population before and after risk-adjustment. Methods and Findings We used information from 16 independent data sources, including 22 million all-payer inpatient admissions from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (which covers regions where 50\% of the U.S. population lives) to analyze 24 inpatient mortality, inpatient safety, and prevention outcomes. We compared outcome variation at state, hospital referral region, hospital service area, county, and hospital levels. Risk-adjusted outcomes were calculated after adjusting for population factors, co-morbidities, and health system factors. Even after risk-adjustment, there exists large geographical variation in outcomes. The variation in healthcare outcomes exceeds the well publicized variation in US healthcare costs. On average, we observed a 2.1-fold difference in risk-adjusted mortality outcomes between top- and bottom-decile hospitals. For example, we observed a 2.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted acute myocardial infarction inpatient mortality. On average a 10.2-fold difference in risk-adjusted patient safety outcomes exists between top and bottom-decile hospitals, including an 18.3-fold difference for risk-adjusted Central Venous Catheter Bloodstream Infection rates. A 3.0-fold difference in prevention outcomes exists between top- and bottom-decile counties on average; including a 2.2-fold difference for risk-adjusted congestive heart failure admission rates. The population, co-morbidity, and health system factors accounted for a range of R2 between 18{\textendash}64\% of variability in mortality outcomes, 3{\textendash}39\% of variability in patient safety outcomes, and 22{\textendash}70\% of variability in prevention outcomes. Conclusion The amount of variability in health outcomes in the U.S. is large even after accounting for differences in population, co-morbidities, and health system factors. These findings suggest that: 1) additional examination of regional and local variation in risk-adjusted outcomes should be a priority; 2) assumptions of uniform hospital quality that underpin rationale for policy choices (such as narrow insurance networks or antitrust enforcement) should be challenged; and 3) there exists substantial opportunity for outcomes improvement in the US healthcare system.},

            We use administrative records on the incomes of more than 40 million children and their parents to describe three features of intergenerational mobility in the United States. First, we characterize the joint distribution of parent and child income at the national level. The conditional expectation of child income given parent income is linear in percentile ranks. On average, a 10 percentile increase in parent income is associated with a 3.4 percentile increase in a child{\textquoteright}s income. Second, intergenerational mobility varies substantially across areas within the United States. For example, the probability that a child reaches the top quintile of the national income distribution starting from a family in the bottom quintile is 4.4\% in Charlotte but 12.9\% in San Jose. Third, we explore the factors correlated with upward mobility. High mobility areas have (i) less residential segregation, (ii) less income inequality, (iii) better primary schools, (iv) greater social capital, and (v) greater family stability. Although our descriptive analysis does not identify the causal mechanisms that determine upward mobility, the publicly available statistics on intergenerational mobility developed here can facilitate research on such mechanisms.},

In this article we update estimates of the impact of race and education on past and present life expectancy, examine trends in disparities from 1990 through 2008, and place observed disparities in the context of a rapidly aging society that is emerging at a time of optimism about the next revolution in longevity. We found that in 2008 US adult men and women with fewer than twelve years of education had life expectancies not much better than those of all adults in the 1950s and 1960s. When race and education are combined, the disparity is even more striking. In 2008 white US men and women with 16 years or more of schooling had life expectancies far greater than black Americans with fewer than 12 years of education{\textemdash}14.2 years more for white men than black men, and 10.3 years more for white women than black women.},

Ethnic minorities have less access to transplantation, are less likely to be listed for transplantation, and experience a higher rate of graft failure.

They include a combination of behavioral, social, environmental, and occupational factors, as well as potential intended or unintended discrimination within the healthcare system. Immunologic factors such as human leukocyte antigen matching, composition of the organ donor pool, and patient immune response, all of which affect post-transplantation graft rejection rates and patient survival, also contribute to health disparities between ethnic groups.},

Although many studies have investigated the linkages between race, socioeconomic status, and mortality, this article is the first to measure how much of the life expectancy gap remains after differences in mortality are purged of the compositional differences in socioeconomic characteristics between blacks and whites. The decomposition is facilitated by a reweighting technique that creates counterfactual estimation samples in which the distribution of income, education, employment and occupation, marital status, and other theoretically relevant variables among blacks is made to match the distribution of these variables among whites. For males, 80\% of the black-white gap in life expectancy at age 1 can be accounted for by differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. For females, 70\% percent of the gap is accounted for. Labor force participation, occupation, and (among women only) marital status have almost no additional power to explain the black-white disparity in life expectancy after precise measures for income and education are controlled for.},

            In medicine, the reasons for variation in treatment rates across hospitals serving similar patients are not well understood. Some interpret this variation as unwarranted and push standardization of care as a way of reducing allocative inefficiency. An alternative interpretation is that hospitals with greater expertise in a treatment use it more because of their comparative advantage, suggesting that standardization is misguided. A simple economic model provides an empirical framework to separate these explanations. Estimating this model with data for heart attack patients, we find evidence of substantial variation across hospitals in allocative inefficiency and comparative advantage, with most hospitals overusing treatment in part because of incorrect beliefs about their comparative advantage. A stylized welfare calculation suggests that eliminating allocative inefficiency would increase the total benefits from the treatment that we study by 44\%.},
